Congratulations on making it to the last challenge in this series, I hope you've found the experience so far to be enlightening and useful. With any luck you haven't found any of the tasks up until now too hard, but at the same time
I hope that they weren't too easy.

For the last challenge I am not going to give you any boiler plate code, meaning you must write the entire program from scratch. Please for the love of god make sure that you place your code in the right place in your solution
That means that .h files go in the Header file folder, and .cpp files in the Source files directory.

Polynomial Equation Program:
	An example of a polynomial equation looks like this:
		
		2x^2 + 2

	You may remember these from back in GCSE Maths classes. We can generate a set of numbers from the above equation by substituting x for values in a given range (e.g. 0-10)
	We can also take in a set of numbers that have been generated by a polynomial equation and we can work backwards to calculate the equation that was used to generate that set of numbers.
	
	A component of each equation has the format: 1x^2
	where 1 is known as the COEFFICIENT and 2 is known as the EXPONENT.
	A whole equation can be made up of as many of these components as you want where the components are always added and if you don't want them to be added your coefficient must be made negative.
	If you want to make a constant value, the exponent must be set to 0 e.g. 50x^0 would be the constant value of 50.

Task:
	- Write a program that allows a user to create a polynomial equation.
		- User can choose how many components of the equation there are.
		- User should be able to input the coefficient and exponent for each component of the equation.
	- Allow the user to specify a range of numbers, then have their created equation produce a set of numbers for the given range.
		- Print the numbers to the console.
		- Stretch: Write the set of numbers, along with the equation to a .txt file called "Write_output_set.txt".

	- Stretch goal: Read in a set of numbers from a .txt file - Sequence_A-D.txt in the resource files folder.
	- From the set of numbers calculate the equation that was used to create that set of numbers - you can assume that these equations were generated in a range that always starts from 0.
	- Print the solved equation to the console and make note of it in a .txt file.

	- The program should have a menu that they can access through the command line.

	IF STUCK AT ANY POINT JUST ASK, I AM HAPPY TO HELP!
