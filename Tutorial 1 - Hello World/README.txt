Hello Guys :)

These README files will contain the instructions needed for each of the following tutorials so please read them carefully.

Obviously we will start easy but as these go on the instructions may get more complex and confusing.
I encourage you to Google stuff and get confident with searching for solutions online, HOWEVER if at any point you don't understand the code you are writing it is important that you ask me what is going on, as it is useful if you know exactly what the
code you are writing is doing.


Extra Information:

"#include <iostream>" - Preprocessor directive linking external functions. iostream basically includes the functions that allow us to print to the console.

"int main()" - A function named as "main" basically defines the entry point into the program. The preceeding "int" defines the return type of the function, in this case an integer will be returned.
				Note: Having many functions name "main" in the same project will cause compile errors.

"return 0" - What is returned from the function. A main return code of 0 signifies that the program executed without any errors.

Most lines of code should have a semi-colon at the end which acts as a seperator that the compiler uses to signify seperate instructions.



Task:

For the first task I'm going to ask you to do the classic computer science programming intro: printing "Hello World" to the console!

	- Open HelloWorld.cpp in the "Source Files" directory.
	- Write your code in the "main" function.
	- To run it click the button at the top of the IDE called "Windows Local Debugger".
	- Have Fun :)

Stretch:

	- How can we simplify the print statement? (Hint: Try researching namespaces)
	- Can you think of any drawbacks and advantages of using namespaces in our code.
